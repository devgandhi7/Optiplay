# OptiPlay-Analytics

## Overview
Fantasy Premier League (FPL) has evolved into a highly competitive and strategic game, where data analytics significantly enhances decision-making. This project investigates how analytical techniques can support player selection, forecast performance, and evaluate the influence of home-field advantage. The goal is to equip FPL enthusiasts and analysts with actionable insights that improve team performance and strategy.

## Key Insights
- Demonstrated the rising importance of data-driven strategies in modern FPL team-building.
- Improved player selection and game-week planning through statistical analysis.
- Identified critical performance metrics that inform decisions on recruitment, training, and matchday strategies.
- Provided in-depth understanding of home-field advantage and its variable impact across teams.

## Analytical Approach
- Applied multiple statistical and machine learning methods including:
  - Lasso and Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Chi-Square Tests
  - Clustering techniques
- Analyzed historical FPL data to extract patterns related to player fitness, form, and match context.
- Evaluated the role of match location in performance variability, offering tactical planning benefits.

## Challenges and Limitations
- Dataset constraints excluded qualitative variables such as team chemistry, player mentality, and match-day conditions.
- Player statistics can be influenced by non-quantifiable factors like fatigue and confidence.
- Future enhancements should include psychological indicators, team dynamics, and data from multiple FPL seasons.

## Project Highlights
- Explored 30+ features impacting FPL performance.
- Grouped features into three categories:
  1. Player performance metrics
  2. Game-related variables
  3. Contextual/miscellaneous factors
- Analyzed how user preferences and home-ground familiarity shape player selection and effectiveness.

## Future Directions
- Extend the framework to include other football leagues for a broader impact.
- Adapt the model for other fantasy sports such as American Football.
- Integrate AI/ML for real-time predictions, enabling dynamic updates and smarter gameplay strategies.

## Final Thoughts
This project bridges analytics and fantasy sports by uncovering how player performance, user behavior, and match context interact in shaping FPL outcomes. While current limitations exist, future iterations aim to incorporate richer data and AI-powered automation, advancing the field of fantasy sports analytics toward real-time, personalized optimization.
